                        <p>Her son lives in Spain, her daughter lives in America and her grandson lives in France. 
                            she is not only a fiction character. she really exists in the world.
                            She is a 32 years old panda, Bing-Bing, in Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding of Sichuan, China.</p>
                        <p>Why this panda’s name calls Bing-Bing? Bing-Bing was born on sixth of August ,1986 and that day was very hot,
                             so the worker of research center gave her name, Bing-Bing, 
                             because the Chinese character of “Bing” was the same meaning as ice.</p>
                        <p>Bing-Bing has six children and all of her children are popular in different countries. 
                            Nowadays, due to the age of Bing-Bing, she no longer needs to take care of her descendants. 
                            The researcher provides a comfortable environment for Bing-Bing to let her enjoy rest of life.</p>
